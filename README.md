# Game_2048
A java project recreating the popular 2048 game. A personal project of mine after my 10th grade.

How to use:

1. Run the java program in a terminal.
2. Enter the number on the numpad corresponding to the arrow key for the direction you intend to swipe and press enter.
3. Press 0 for undo and press enter (instead of a direction).
